# Deep Modeling with Deep Dipole

## Overview
While the Deep Potential model characterizes the potential energy surface of an atomic system, the Deep Dipole model predicts atomistic electric dipoles and global polarization.  
In this session we will introduce its background, training and application.

## Objectives (see the slides for details)
0. Introduction to wannierization and the Deep Dipole model.
1. Perform maximal localization of wannier centers with the Wannier90 code, based on orbitals from self-consistent DFT calcultions. 
2. Train a deep dipole model
3. Analyze a MD trajectory with the Deep Dipole model.
